# Travel App

A travel app, combining all of your Front End skills into an amazing capstone project for your portfolio. Utilize multiple APIs to present a user with all they need to know about their trip.

## Installating and Running the app

Run `npm install` in the terminal to get the packages required

## Pre-Requesties:
- Make sure you populate the `.env-CHANGEME` file with appropriate values.
- RUN `npm start` to boot up the application.

## API's used

- [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
- [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/dashboard)

## Chosen Suggestions to Make My Project Stand Out

* Allow the user to remove the trip.
* Use Local Storage to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there.
* Incorporate icons into forecast.
